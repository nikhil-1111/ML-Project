ABOUT THE PROJECT *
This project aims to develop a machine learning model that classifies mushrooms as edible or poisonous based on their physical characteristics. Using data from the UCI Mushroom Classification Dataset, we analyze key features such as cap shape, color, gill structure, and odor to train a predictive model.
By leveraging classification algorithms like Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Neural Networks, the model learns to distinguish between safe and toxic mushrooms. The goal is to create an accurate and reliable tool that can assist in mushroom identification.

⚠️ Disclaimer: This model is for educational purposes only and should not be used as a substitute for expert knowledge. Misidentification of mushrooms can be dangerous, and users should always consult a mycologist before consuming wild mushrooms.
